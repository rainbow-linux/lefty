# Lefty

Continuous delivery server that uses Scala for its configuration.

```scala
import gay.rainbowlinux.infra.cd.lefty._
import gay.rainbÄ±wlinux.infra.cd.lefty.DSL._

object LeftyFile extends Pipeline {
  Lefty run Pipeline |
    "Build" stage {
        "Install dependencies" step {
            exec "npm install"
        } | "Compile" step {
            exec "npm run build"
        }
    } |

    "Test" stage {
        "Run unit tests" step {
            exec "npm test"
        }
    } |

    "Deploy" stage {
        depends on s"${Lefty host workdir}/deploy.sh" as s"${Lefty workdir}/deploy.sh"
        "Deploy to production" step {
            change into Lefty workdir
            exec s"${Lefty workdir}/deploy.sh"
        }
    } every 10 minutes
}

# The goal

The goal is to have a syntax as close to Bash scripts as possible, while also being close to English as much as possible
